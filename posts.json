  "content": "Northern spotted owls (NSO) are medium-sized, friendly owls.  They prefer old growth forest to raise their young.  This is because they do not make their own nests. Instead they look for abandoned nests from other species, or platforms or holes in snags.  They are particular about their food, those in the lower range preferring woodrats while those in the upper range choosing flying squirrels.  Their call consists of four notes, the males sounding deeper than the female.  They are one of the most studied species in the world as they are considered an indicator species of the health of their ecosystem and their decline has meant there is a problem in the ecosystem they are a part of.  This is due to aggressive logging practices, both in their range and beyond as Canadian logging has led to the introduction of barred owls in the spotted owl habitat, whom are indirect and direct competitors.",
